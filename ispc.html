<p>
You can get visual studio to automatically compile ISPC files by associating the ispc extension with a custom build target. This information comes from <a href="http://reedbeta.com/blog/custom-toolchain-with-msbuild/">Nathan Reed</a><br />
</p>
<p>
To get this to work simply copy and paste the ispc.xml: <script src="https://gist.github.com/ocohen/60fa1e1a05dd99e58dff752250239a4f.js"></script>

and ispc.targets:<script src="https://gist.github.com/ocohen/4a5aba1fc4177b388ddd0ec09f81bdcc.js"></script>


 and place them alongside your .vcxproj file. Inside Visual Studio right click on your project and select Build Dependencies -&gt; Build Customization. Select Find Existing and locate the ispc.targets file. You may need to re-add ispc files into your project in order to compile them initially. You will need ispc.exe to be in your windows PATH.</p>

<p>
This should give incremental compiling and error messages. However, I could not find an easy way to automatically link against the generated .o files so you will need to manually add them as additional linker inputs.</p>
<p>
The generated files are &lt;file&gt;.ispc.h and &lt;file&gt;.ispc.o
